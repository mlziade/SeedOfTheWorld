# Seed of the World

A project to try to determine what is the seed of our planet Earth.

## Idea

Divide the world into a grid and assign a value to that topographic location. The value can represent things such as elevation or check for body of water.
Use these values to create a representation of the world. We can maybe try to create a seed that can be used to generate the world following a set of rules.
